Change the argument of it to give your scene a nice overall lighting.    \r\nAdding at least TWO point lights with different colors.  \r\nChange the skybox. We provide you with a unity package. You can also find free ones in Asset Store.  \r\n**Extra Credit:**  \r\nUsing a spot light to enhance the atmosphere.  \r\n\r\n\r\n**Task 3: Create  materials for your objects**  \r\nCreate materials for your object.  \r\nInclude at least one diffuse one and a reflective one.   \r\nAdd Texture to at least one of them.  \r\n\r\n**Extra Credit:**  \r\nCreate material Glass   \r\nTry normal maps and emission maps.  \r\n\r\n**Task 4: Create an animation for camera**  \r\nCreate an animator controller to your main camera.  \r\nUse unity  animating tool to make a easy animation for it.   \r\n\r\n**Extra Credit:**  \r\n (Note: if you are doing this one, make any animation to an object instead of camera.)  \r\n  Attached are references for useful built-in functions for this task. Read them and try to write a controller that allows your camera to move around according to inputs.   \r\nhttp://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform-position.html  \r\nhttp://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.Translate.html  \r\nhttp://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.LookAt.html   \r\nhttp://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.GetKey.html  \r\nhttp://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Task 5: Build your scene**  \r\nFollowing the steps we showed on class, you can build your scene now.  \r\nYou can leave the settings default ones.    \r\n\r\nNOTE: You can always go to http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html and search for help.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
